## If you have previously version 0.0.2 or 0.0.1

You need to convert the USER_CRASH_DATE from Text to Date format, the solution is execute a script:

modify_db.js

Edit the script:

```
var NAME_COLLECTION = "your_collection";
var DB_URL = "mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/your_db";
```

And Execute

```
node modify_db.js
```


## How to config ACRA Class in Android

1. Config Acra Class in application with the url of the server

2. Configuration URL in Java Class (http://SERVER:PORT_SERVER/logs/NAME_APP)

 2.1. SERVER (IP or DNS)

 2.2. PORT_SERVER (PORT WEB SERVER) 

 2.3. NAME_APP (NAME APP where will be save all the crash)

 * Example url: http://my_server:port_server/logs/my_app

```Java

import org.acra.*;
import org.acra.annotation.*;
@ReportsCrashes(formUri = "http://SERVER:PORT_SERVER/logs/NAME_APP", formKey="")
public class MyApplication extends Application {
  @Override
  public void onCreate() {
    // The following line triggers the initialization of ACRA
    ACRA.init(this);
    super.onCreate();
  }
}

```
